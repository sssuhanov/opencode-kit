## What I do

- Flag empty notes, placeholders, and inconsistent naming that can pollute backlinks and dashboards.
- Flag non-content noise (e.g., `.DS_Store`) and other avoidable clutter.

## When to use me

- During periodic cleanup.
- Before/after a reorganization.
- When dashboards/backlinks look noisy.

## Issue tracking rule

If you find a concrete problem worth fixing:

- Propose tagging it with `#needs-fix` (lowercase).
- Propose creating a short tracking note that describes:
  - the problem
  - affected files/folders
  - suggested fix options
  - how to verify

Default location for tracking notes:

- `1 Projects/Vault Maintenance/`

Important: Ask the user before adding tags or creating tracking notes.
