description: Rules for working in this Obsidian PARA vault (YAML, linking, structure, safe edits).
compatibility: opencode
metadata:
  domain: obsidian
  scope: vault

## What I do

- Enforce PARA placement: `1 Projects/`, `2 Areas/`, `3 Resources/`, `4 Archives/`, `5 Support/`.
- Keep notes Obsidian-friendly: clear headings, blank lines around blocks, readable lists.
- Require YAML front matter for work notes and keep keys tidy.
- Prefer documenting plugin behavior over editing `.obsidian/` files directly.

## When to use me

- Before creating or moving notes/folders in this vault.
- Before changing templates, dataview blocks, or recurring workflows.

## How to operate

- Ask the user before any file changes.
- When unsure, propose 2–3 options (folder placement, naming, tags).
