# PARA folder structure (general)

PARA is a popular way to organize a knowledge base:

- `Projects/` — time-bounded outcomes you are actively finishing.
- `Areas/` — ongoing responsibilities with no end date.
- `Resources/` — reference material organized by topic.
- `Archives/` — completed/inactive material.

## How to apply

- Don’t assume a vault uses PARA; confirm with the user first.
- If the vault does use PARA, prefer keeping top-level folders stable.
- Ask before reorganizing large numbers of notes.

## Common pitfalls

- Moving notes without updating links/backlinks.
- Changing folder names that dashboards/queries depend on.
