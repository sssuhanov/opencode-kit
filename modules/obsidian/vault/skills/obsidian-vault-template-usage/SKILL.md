## What I do

- Explain which folders auto-apply templates via Templater.
- Explain which templates are manual and where notes should live.
- Keep guidance aligned with the canonical vault docs.

## When to use me

- When creating a new note and you’re unsure which folder/template to use.
- When adding or changing templates, especially folder template mappings.

## How to operate

- Ask the user before any file changes.
- Prefer updating `5 Support/AI/Templates - Usage Guide.md` when template behavior changes.

## Vault references

- Canonical guide: `5 Support/AI/Templates - Usage Guide.md`
